# GetAndPostRequest
I learned how to make a get and post request on MongoDB database.

There are 5 main types of HTTP requests

1. GET:  GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server. 
2. POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.
3. PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.
4. PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.
5. DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.
